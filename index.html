            My name is Kufreabasi and I'm from Nigeria. I'm very passionate about computer programming and web
            development so I can solve problems, become more creative and contribute my quota in the digital society.
            I'm currently pursuing a Degree in Software Development in BYU Idaho through BYU Pathway Worldwide. Some of
            my hobbies and skills include hiking, graphic designing, photography, chatting and having fun with my
            friends.
